# 2222

"Two Twenty-Two Two" is a game 🎲

for people 🫣 who like to be silly

and know a tiny 🤏 bit of programming.

## How to play

Implement the following in a programming system of your choice.

Your program should:

#### 1️⃣ Load a list of 2222 words.

* You can use the file `2222.txt` in this repo, or make your own list — but it needs to be exactly `2222` real words.
* `2222.txt` is four-letter words. It does have a few cuss words that are fun to say. It only has words that are fun, no bummers.

#### 2️⃣ Display each word for `0.6039604` seconds.

* Yes, `0.6039604`. This is a serious game. Math matters.

#### 3️⃣ As each word appears, you read the word out loud.

* Don't stop if you make mistakes. Keep reading until all the words are done.

#### 4️⃣ You win!

You can spend as long as you like implementing the game, but I suggest speedrunning this part! Just make it work, be sloppy, be slippy, be silly. Pick a language you always wanted to try. Try it in several, and compare. Hell, do it in eToys, or AgentSheets, or modal.

Once the game is implemented, it'll take roughly 22 minutes and 22 seconds to play. If you play the whole way through, it'll feel _totally bizarre_. In a good way. You've probably never done anything quite like this before.

## No Rules!

This game is whatever you want it to be. There are no rules! Have fun!

But—

There is one rule:

**You have to share.**

That's the most important rule of all.

Here are some suggested ways to share:

* Submit your implementation to me, so I can add it to this repo!
  * You can make a PR, open an issue, message me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion), find me at SPLASH con in October and hand me a CD-R, or whatever.

* Record or live-stream yourself playing the game!
  * One extra rule in this case: the viewer needs to be able to see your code.
  * Send me a link to your stream/video! (PR, issue, [Masto](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion), whatever)

## Variations

Variations are encouraged! For instance, here's what I call the **speedrun** variation:

* Shuffle the order of the words.
* Keep track how many times you mess up.
  * Eg: Make it so that if you mash something on your keyboard, it increments a "deaths" counter.
* Instead of advancing the words every `0.6039604` seconds, add a button to advance to the next word.

With these rules, scoring works as follows:

* Any% — Try to get as far as you can without messing up. Your score is how many words you said before you messed up. Higher score is better.
* 100% — If you get all the way to the end without messing up, your score is your time. Lower is better. This is the ultimate game mode for true sickos. 💚

Lots of other variations are possible — go nuts.

## Watch someone else play

But, like… spoilers. I suggest giving it a try for yourself first.
