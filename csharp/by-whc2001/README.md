# C# Implementation of 2222

> Note that only the most basic game logic is implemented.

## Build

The project uses `.NET 8.0`. Ensure that you have .NET 8.0 SDK installed.

The solution is created using Visual Studio. It's preferable to use Visual Studio to build. Open `2222.sln` and run `Build -> Build Solution` (or press Ctrl+Shift+B).

Alternatively, you can build using the .net CLI by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet build 2222.csproj
```

The generated executable will be in the `bin/Debug/net8.0` directory. Copy the dictionary file `2222.txt` to the same directory and run the executable to play.
