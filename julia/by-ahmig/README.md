# 2222 in Julia

## Quickstart

Get [Julia](https://julialang.org/), come [here](/julia/by-ahmig/) and run:

```shell
julia --project=. src/main.jl [shuffle] [manual] [time=MM[:SS]]
```

## Game modes

- `shuffle`: words come in a random order.
- `manual`: press ENTER to advance to the next word.
- `time`: choose the length of your game. For example, to play `1111`, run `2222` with `time=11:11` and stop playing on word 1111. This mode is incompatible with `manual` unless your internal clock is exceptionally good.
